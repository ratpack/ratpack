/**
 * A buildable strategy for responding based on the HTTP "Accepts" request header.
 * <p>
 * A by-accepts-responder is created by {@link Context#getAccepts()}.
 * It is used to respond differently based on what content the client is willing to accept.
 * This is useful when a given handler can provide content of more than one type (i.e. content negotiation).
 * <p>
 * The response to use will be selected based on parsing the "Accepts" header, respecting quality weighting and wildcard matching.
 * The order that types are added to the responder is significant for wildcard matching.
 * The earliest registered type that matches the wildcard will be used.
 * <p>

 * class MyHandler implements Handler {
 *   public void handle(final Context exchange) {
 *     // Do processing common to all methods …
 *
 *     exchange.getAccepts().
 *       type("application/json", new Runnable() {
 *         public void run() {
 *           // JSON responding logic
 *         }
 *       }).
 *       type("text/html", new Runnable() {
 *         public void run() {
 *           // HTML handling logic
 *         }
 *       }).
 *       build(); // finalize
 *   }
 * }
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * If you are using Groovy, you can use closures as the definitions (because closures implement {@link Runnable}),
 * along with {@code Buildable.with}…

 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * You <b>must</b> call the {@link #build()} method to finalise the responder. Otherwise, nothing will happen.
 * <p>
 * If there is no action registered with the responder before {@link #build()} is called, or the client does not accept any
 * of the given types, a {@code 406} will be issued to the {@link Context#clientError(int)}
 * that the responder is associated with.
 * <p>
 * Only the last added runnable for a type will be used.
 * Adding a subsequent runnable for the same type will replace the previous.
