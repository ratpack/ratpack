/**
 * An exchange represents to the processing of a particular request.
 * <p>
 * It provides access to the request and response, along with the current <i>service</i>.
 * It is also the fundamental routing mechanism.
 * <p>
 * Different handlers that participate in the processing of an exchange may actually receive different instances.
 * Handler implementations should not assume that there is only one {@code Context} object during processing.
 * </p>
 * <h3>Routing</h3>
 * <p>
 * Handlers either finalize the exchange by sending the response, or delegating to another handler.
 * This can be done via either the {@link #next()} method or one of the {@code insert()} methods.
 * <p>
 * The {@link #next()} method will simply delegate the processing to the next handler in line.
 * If a handler does not want to process the exchange it should call this method.
 * No further request/response processing should be done after this as the exchange is from that point on
 * the responsibility of the next handler. The last handler always simply sends a 404 back to the client.
 * <p>
 * The {@code insert()} methods can be used to insert one or more handlers in the pipeline and then delegate
 * to the first inserted handler.
 * The last inserted handler's “next” handler will become the “next” handler of this exchange.
 * That is, the “insert” operation is inserting before the current next handler.
 * </p>
 * <h4>Inserting with a different service</h4>
 * <p>
 * There are variants of the {@code insert()} method that allow the injection of a new service.
 * The given service will <b>only</b> be the service for the inserted handlers.
 * It is in effect “scoped” to just the inserted handlers.
 * The service for existing handlers that are already part of the pipeline cannot be influenced.
 * This gives processing a hierarchical nature.
 * Handlers can delegate to a tree of handlers (inserted handlers can insert other handlers) that
 * operate in different contexts.
 * This can be used to partition the application and do things such as use a different {@link org.ratpackframework.error.ServerErrorHandler}
 * for a portion of the application.
 * </p>
