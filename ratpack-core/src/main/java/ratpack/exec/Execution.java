/**
 * A <em>logical</em> stream of execution, which is potentially serialized over many threads.
 * <p>
 * Ratpack is non blocking.
 * This requires that IO and other blocking operations are performed asynchronously.
 * In completely synchronous execution, the thread and the call stack serve as the representation of a stream of execution,
 * with the execution being bound to a single thread exclusively for its entire duration.
 * The {@code Execution} concept in Ratpack brings some of the characteristics of the traditional single-thread exclusive model
 * to the asynchronous, non-exclusive, environment.
 * <p>
 * A well understood example of a logical <em>stream of execution</em> in the web application environment is the handling of a request.
 * This can be thought of as a single logical operation; the request comes in and processing happens until the response is sent back.
 * Many web application frameworks exclusively assign a thread to such a stream of execution, from a large thread pool.
 * If a blocking operation is performed during the execution, the thread sits <em>waiting</em> until it can continue (e.g. the IO completes, or the contended resource becomes available).
 * Thereby the <em>segments</em> of the execution are <em>serialized</em> and the call stack provides execution context.
 * Ratpack supports the <em>non-blocking</em> model, where threads do not wait.
 * Instead of threads waiting for IO or some future event, they are returned to the “pool” to be used by other executions (and therefore the pool can be smaller).
 * When the IO completes or the contended resource becomes available, execution continues with a new call stack and possibly on a different thread.
 * <p>
 * <b>The execution object underpins an entire logical operation, even when that operation may be performed by multiple threads.</b>
 * <p>
 * Importantly, it also <em>serializes</em> execution segments by way of the {@link ratpack.exec.ExecControl#promise(ratpack.func.Action)} method.
 * These methods are fundamentally asynchronous in that they facilitate performing operations where the result will arrive later without waiting for the result,
 * but are synchronous in the operations the perform are serialized and not executed concurrently or in parallel.
 * <em>Crucially</em>, this means that state that is local to an execution does not need to be thread safe.
 * <h3>Executions and request handling</h3>
 * <p>
 * The execution object actually underpins the {@link ratpack.handling.Context} objects that are used when handling requests.
 * It is rarely used directly when request handling, except when concurrency or parallelism is required to process data via the {@link ratpack.handling.Context#exec()} method.
 * Moreover, it provides its own error handling and completion mechanisms.
 * </p>
