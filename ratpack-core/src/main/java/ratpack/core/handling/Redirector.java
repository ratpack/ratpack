/**
 * Interprets objects as a {@code Location} header value, and issues the redirect response.

 * The redirector is not typically called directly.
 * Instead, handlers use the {@link #redirect(Context, int, Object)} method (or similar) that obtains a redirector from the context registry.
 * Ratpack provides a {@link #standard() default implementation} that is used unless a custom implementation is available.
 * <p>
 * It is rarely necessary to implement a custom redirector.
 * One reason to do so though is to use domain objects to represent redirect destinations instead of strings.
 * For example, a custom redirector may know how to transform a {@code Person} object within your application to a relevant URL.
 * It may be more convenient to implement such a mapping between domain objects and URLs within a custom redirector.
 * Such custom redirectors typically wrap the {@link #standard()} implementation.

   * One exception to this rule is the case of {@link java.net.URI}, where the {@link URI#toASCIIString()} is used.
   * <p>

   * <ol>
   * <li>starts with {@code http://} or {@code https://} (<i>literal URL</i>) - value is used without modification</li>
   * <li>starts with {@code //} (<i>protocol relative</i>) - current public request protocol is prepended (based on {@link PublicAddress})
   * <li>starts with {@code /} (<i>absolute path</i>) - protocol, host and port are prepended (based on {@link PublicAddress})
   * <li>else (<i>relative path</i>) - protocol, host, port and current request path are prepended (based on {@link PublicAddress} and {@link Request#getPath()})
