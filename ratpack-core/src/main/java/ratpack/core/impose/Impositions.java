/**
 * A mechanism for imposing things on an application from the outside and typically during testing.
 * <p>
 * The impositions mechanism exists primarily to facilitate convenient overriding of configuration and behaviour at test time.
 * {@link ratpack.test.MainClassApplicationUnderTest} builds upon this mechanism.
 * It uses the {@link #impose(Impositions, Factory)} to register impositions, while starting up the application under test within the given function.
 * <p>
 * Ratpack “components” are explicitly designed to be aware of impositions.
 * Such components obtain the impositions either via the {@link #current()} method, or via the server registry (e.g. Guice injection).
 * User code does not typically need to be aware of impositions, as impositions are general used to influence upstream configuration.
 * If you do need access to the impositions, prefer obtaining it from the server registry over {@link #current()} as this method is thread sensitive.
 * <p>
 * Actual impositions are implemented as specific classes, known to the consumer.
 * {@link ForceServerListenPortImposition} and {@link UserRegistryImposition} are both examples of such.
 * The consumers of these impositions simply obtain them from the impositions registry.
 * <p>
