/**
 * Informs when the server should be reloaded, during {@link ServerConfig#isDevelopment() development}.
 * <p>
 * During development mode, all reload informants present in the server registry will be asked if the server should reload before serving each request.
 * The term “reload” here specifically refers to rebuilding the server definition by re-<i>executing</i> the function given to the {@link RatpackServer#of(Action)} method that defined the server.
 * <p>
 * Reload informants will never be queried concurrently so can be safely stateful.
 * Calls to {@link #shouldReload(Registry)} are serialised for any given informant, and informants are queried in sequence.
 * <p>
 * Reload informants are queried in the order they are returned by the server registry.
 * If an informant indicates that the server should reload, no further informants will be queried.
 * <p>
 * As reload informants are queried for every request, it is sometimes desirable to internally use some kind of polling technique internally to avoid creating too much overhead.
 * However, implementations do not need to be too performance sensitive as reload informants only apply during development.
 * <p>
 * Reload informants are never queried when not in development mode.
 * It is completely benign for informants to be in the server registry when not in development.
 * <p>
 * Below shows a contrived reload informant that simply asks that the server reload on every other request.
