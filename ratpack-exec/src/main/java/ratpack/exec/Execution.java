/**
 * A logical operation, such as servicing a request, that may be comprised of non contiguous units of work.
 * <p>
 * In a synchronous environment, a logical operation is typically given exclusive access to a thread for its duration.
 * The use of thread local variables for operation global state and try/catch as a global error handling strategy rely on this.
 * The execution construct provides mechanisms to emulate constructs of synchronous programming that cannot be achieved the same way in asynchronous programming.
 * <p>
 * Almost all work that occurs as part of a running Ratpack application happens during an execution.
 * Ratpack APIs such as {@link Promise}, {@link Blocking} etc. can only be used within an execution.
 * Request processing is always within an execution.
 * When initiating other work (e.g. background processing), an execution can be created via {@link Execution#fork()}
 * <p>
 * The term “execution segment” (sometimes just “segment”) is used to refer to a unit of work within an execution.
 * An execution segment has exclusive access to a thread.
 * All executions start with the segment given to the {@link ExecStarter#start(Action)} method.
 * If the initial execution segment does not use any asynchronous APIs, the execution will be comprised of that single segment.
 * When an asynchronous API is used, via {@link Promise#async(Upstream)}, the resumption of work when the result becomes available is within a new execution segment.
 * During any execution segment, the {@link Execution#current()} method will return the current execution, giving global access to the execution object.
 * <p>
 * Segments of an execution are never executed concurrently.
 *
 * <h3>Execution state (i.e. simulating thread locals)</h3>
 * <p>
 * Each execution is a {@link MutableRegistry}.
 * Objects can be added to this registry and then later retrieved at any time during the execution.
 * The registry storage can be leveraged via an {@link ExecInterceptor} to manage thread local storage for execution segments.
 *
 * <h3>Error handling</h3>
 * <p>
 * When starting an execution, a global error handler can be specified via {@link ExecStarter#onError(Action)}.
 * The default error handler simply logs the error to a logger named {@code ratpack.exec.Execution}.
 * <p>
 * The error handler for request processing executions forwards the exception to {@link ratpack.handling.Context#error(Throwable)}.
 *
 * <h3>Cleanup</h3>
 * <p>
 * The {@link #onComplete(AutoCloseable)} method can be used to register actions to invoke or resources to close when the execution completes.
 *
 * @see ExecInterceptor
 * @see ExecInitializer
 * @see ExecController
 * @see Promise
