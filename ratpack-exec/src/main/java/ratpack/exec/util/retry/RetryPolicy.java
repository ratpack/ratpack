 * A strategy object to govern retry behaviours.

 * Implementors should define their own exhaustion policy, i.e. when they will give up retrying.
 * Implementors should track retry attempts, even if they don't leverage it when deciding exhaustion.
 * Exampled of other uses are logging or to customize delays.
 * Implementors should also define what kind of delay will be executed between retries.
 * @see Delay and its implementors for different strategies.
