/**
 * Support for integrating Ratpack applications with Hashicorp's <a href="https://www.consul.io/">Consul</a> service discovery and distributed configuration engine.
 * <h3>Key Features</h3>
 * <p>The Consul support provides the following key features:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>Support for reading data from Consul's distributed Key-Value store as a {@link com.google.common.io.ByteSource}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h3>Using Consul Key-Value store to provide application configuration</h3>
 * <p>
 * The Consul integration provides support for reading values from Consul's Key-Value store as a {@code ByteSource}.
 * The {@code ByteSource} can then be provided to Ratpack's configuration parsing methods:
 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link ratpack.server.ServerConfigBuilder#json(com.google.common.io.ByteSource)}</li>
 * <li>{@link ratpack.server.ServerConfigBuilder#props(com.google.common.io.ByteSource)}</li>
 * <li>{@link ratpack.server.ServerConfigBuilder#yaml(com.google.common.io.ByteSource)}</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * @since 1.5
