Ratpack
=======

A micro web framework for Groovy
--------------------------------

This project is the core Ratpack code. It is of interest to developers wanting to extend the Ratpack framework itself—which hopefully means you!

If you just want to use Ratpack to build a small, Groovy-based web app, then you want the [Ratpack Template](https://github.com/tlberglund/ratpack-template). Go clone that, write your code, and come on back here when you want to hack on the framework.
