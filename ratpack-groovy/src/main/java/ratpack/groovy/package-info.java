/**
 * Support for writing Ratpack applications in the <a href="http://groovy-lang.org">Groovy programming language</a>.
 * <h3>Key Features</h3>
 * <p>The Groovy support provides the following key features:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li>A {@link groovy.lang.Closure} based Handler Chain building DSL - see {@link ratpack.groovy.handling.GroovyChain}.</li>
 * <li>Dynamic templates based on embedded groovy code - see {@link ratpack.groovy.template.internal.TextTemplateRenderer}.</li>
 * <li>Defining applications as a single script - see {@link ratpack.groovy.Groovy.Ratpack}.</li>
 * </ul>
 * <h3>Use of <a href="http://groovy.codehaus.org/Closures">closures</a> and {@link groovy.lang.DelegatesTo}</h3>
 * <p>
 * Ratpack makes heavy use of a feature of Groovy 2.1 that allows the delegate of a closure to be specified via the type system.
 * Namely, the {@link groovy.lang.DelegatesTo} annotation.
 * On all parts of the API where a {@link groovy.lang.Closure} is being accepted as a method parameter, the parameter will be
 * annotated with this annotation. This specifies the type of the closure <i>delegate</i> object during execution.
 * For more information on closure delegates, see <a href="http://mrhaki.blogspot.co.uk/2009/11/groovy-goodness-setting-closures.html">this article</a>.
 * <p>
 * When reading the API reference, it's important to take note of the {@link groovy.lang.DelegatesTo} annotation on closure parameters.
 * This parameter indicates what type to look at for information on what the closure can do.
 * </p>
